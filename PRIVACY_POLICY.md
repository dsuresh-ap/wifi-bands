# Privacy Policy for WiFi Bands

**Last Updated: February 7, 2026**

## Overview

WiFi Bands ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, how it's used, and your rights regarding your data.

## Information We Access

### WiFi Network Information
The App accesses the following WiFi network data from your device:
- Network names (SSIDs)
- Network identifiers (BSSIDs/MAC addresses)
- Signal strength (RSSI)
- Channel information
- Security settings
- Noise levels
- Beacon intervals
- Country codes
- Channel widths
- Supported data rates

### Location Services
The App requests Location Services permission as required by macOS to scan for WiFi networks. This is a system requirement for accessing WiFi information and is enforced by Apple's CoreWLAN framework.

**Important:** The App does NOT track your physical location. Location Services permission is only used to enable WiFi scanning capabilities as mandated by macOS.

## How We Use Information

All WiFi network data accessed by the App is:
- **Processed locally** on your device only
- **Used solely** to display network information and provide analytics about WiFi band utilization and interference
- **Stored temporarily** in device memory for signal history visualization
- **Never transmitted** to external servers or third parties
- **Never associated** with your identity or personal information

## Data Storage

The App stores signal history data temporarily in your device's memory for visualization purposes. This data:
- Is stored only during the App's runtime
- Is automatically cleared when networks are no longer visible
- Is deleted when you close the App
- Is never backed up or synchronized to cloud services

## Data Sharing

**We do not collect, transmit, or share any data with third parties.** All WiFi network information remains on your device and is never sent over the internet.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children or any users. The App is designed solely to scan and display WiFi network information available to your device.

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over the App's permissions:
- **Location Services:** You can enable or disable Location Services for the App at any time in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Location Services
- **WiFi Access:** You can control the App's ability to access WiFi information through macOS system permissions
- **Data Deletion:** All data is automatically cleared when you close the App. No persistent personal data is stored.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
